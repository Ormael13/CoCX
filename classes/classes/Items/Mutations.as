    /*Purified LaBova:
     This will be one of the items that the player will have to give Marble to purify her, but there is a limit on how much she can be purified in this way.
     Effects on the player:
     Mostly the same, but without animal transforms, corruption, and lower limits on body changes
     Hips and ass cap at half the value for LaBova
     Nipple growth caps at 1 inch
     Breasts cap at E or DD cup
     Raises lactation to a relatively low level, reduces high levels: \"Your breasts suddenly feel less full, it seems you aren't lactating at quite the level you where.\"  OR  \"The insides of your breasts suddenly feel bloated.  There is a spray of milk from them, and they settle closer to a more natural level of lactation.\"
     Does not apply the addictive quality
     If the player has the addictive quality, this item can remove that effect

     Enhanced LaBova:
     Something that the player can either make or find later; put it in whenever you want, or make your own item.  This is just a possible suggestion.  If it is given to Marble, she only gains the quad nipples.
     Effects on the player
     Mostly the same, but some of the effects can be more pronounced.  Ie, more str gain from one dose, or more breast growth.
     If the player's nipples are larger than 1 inch in length, this item is guaranteed to give them quad nipples.  This applies to all their breasts; seems like it ould be a good compromise on whether or not cowgirls should have 4 breasts.
     Very small chance to increase fertility (normally this increase would only happen when the player forces a creature to drink their milk).

    /*Effects:
      Boosts Speed stat
      Ass reduction
      Testicles return inside your body (could be reverted by the use of succubi delight)
      Can change penis into reptilian form  (since there's a lot of commentary here not knowing where to go, let me lay it out.)
     the change will select one cock (randomly if you have multiple)
     said cock will become two reptilian cocks
     these can then be affected separately, so if someone wants to go through the effort of removing one and leaving themselves with one reptile penis, they have the ability to do that
     This also means that someone who's already reached the maximum numbers of dicks cannot get a reptilian penis unless they remove one first
     "Your reptilian penis is X.X inches long and X.X inches thick.  The sheath extends halfway up the shaft, thick and veiny, while the smooth shaft extends out of the sheath coming to a pointed tip at the head. "
      Grow poisonous fangs (grants Poison Bite ability to player, incompatible with the sting ability, as it uses the same poison-meter)
      Causes your tongue to fork
      Legs fuse together and dissolve into snake tail  (grants Constrict ability to player, said tail can only be covered in scales, independently from the rest of the body)
      If snake tail exists:
        Make it longer, possibly larger (tail length is considered independently of your height, so it doesn't enable you to use the axe, for instance.
        Change tail's color according to location
          [Smooth] Beige and Tan (Desert), [Rough] Brown and Rust (Mountains), [Lush]  Forest Green and Yellow (Forest), [Cold] Blue and White (ice land?), [Fresh] Meadow Green [#57D53B - #7FFF00] and Dark Teal [#008080] (lake) , [Menacing] Black and Red (Demon realm, outside encounters), [Distinguished] Ivory (#FFFFF0) and Royal Purple/Amethyst (#702963) (Factory), [Mossy] Emerald and Chestnut (Swamp), [Arid] Orange and Olive pattern (Tel' Adre)

First-tier effects include 50/50 chance of sable skin with bone-white veins or ivory skin with onyx veins. Second tier, \"wisp-like legs that flit back and forth between worlds,\" or \"wisp-like legs\" for short. Third tier gives an \"Ephemeral\" perk, makes you (10%, perhaps?) tougher to hit, and gives you a skill that replaces tease/seduce—allowing the PC to possess the creature and force it to masturbate to gain lust.

         //Alternatively, add the same effects as Masochist and Sadist but don't allow stacking, this way the effects can be removed if the player loses the corrupted nine-tails perk.
         Requirements: Have fox ears and obtain your 9th tail from the Mystic Jewel item.  Must maintain at least 80 corruption and 80 intelligence, fox ears and 9 tails, or lose the perk.
