			//Effect: Slutty Seduction 10, Wizard Endurance 60. Increase tease total damage by x 2 when worn by a wood elf. Inflicting Tease damage reduces the wielder's own lust by a small amount.
			//The wearer of this dress desire and pleasure is no longer vexed by the limitations of mortal flesh allowing one to keep control over their lust long enough to claim victory by diluting their own lust within the ambiant natural world for a time. So long as a Green Magic spell was cast within the 5 previous rounds the user of this dress effectively is able to maintain their focus and mind entirely to the task at hand at the cost of potentialy turning into a lecherous sex maniac due to all the dilluted lust merging back with the user at the end of combat. There is a small chance for this to backfire instead causing the ambiant flora to turn on and rape the wearer of the dress.
