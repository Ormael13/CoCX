He rapidly taps his boots down upon the moss below while he holds both arms wide in the air like a bird of prey, as though working towards a moment of instant momentum. When that moment comes, the fox turns into a true dervish. He spins about, squats down to pick up the rapier and with the long steel in hand, his swerves become only wider for it. The edge cleaves the air, until he draws it to a standstill and flicks the length around faster than you can follow it. He enacts a series of mock parries and dodges, before extending the long weapon forward with an outstretched hand and a straight spine. With the other arm far back, he adopts a posture of perfect poise.\n\n");

		outputText("From this position he suddenly retreats wildly, jumps backwards and with a frantic kick through the air, lands gracefully again. From there he strides backwards contemptuously and swishes the sword about in wide elegant arcs, like he's mocking the invisible opponent from whom he just escaped into thinking both maneuvers were perfectly calculated through sheer grace. Concentrating hard and starting another maneuver, the fox then closes his eyes. The mien on his snout relaxes when he holds the chin of his triangular head to his chest and centers his balance, to carry the sword around his body in a series of wide sweeps, swiveling on his right foot exactly three times. He only ends the movement by weaving in an extra flick to the side and then putting the tip to the ground, striking a powerful pose. Raphael then throws the steel back towards his hip, twirls it about his side and passes it underneath his arms in elegant fashion, only to tuck it behind his back. A moment of serenity follows where the blade isn't even used.\n\n");

		outputText("With the subtle movement of the fingers on an upraised free hand - to a rhythm known only to the fox - he twirls his unburdened hand across his face while staring at you with a smile that couldn't possibly be any more cocksure. You're relieved. For a moment you thought it had vanished after such a deserving display. He deeply enjoys his little performance, knowing damn well it must be impressive.\n\n");

Drifting lazily towards one foot, he finishes strongly with another series of powerful pirouettes that take him across the entire field within a mere dozen steps. Raphael himself becomes the center calm in his own whirlwind of cleaving cuts. When he veers back into a straight line again, the sight is glorious. Raphael's beautiful long tail is still caught up in the wake of the spin, while his eager blade is already forging ahead in another direction. The two tips are exactly one moment behind and one moment ahead of anything the fox does, like a trailing red shadow and a blurred iron meridian. Before you, he throws the momentum forward, until only the blade swerves around its own forward axis, while he hops about on excited dancing feet. With a beautifully simple thrust, he then simply pierces the rapier forward in a vigorous straight line. It puts all that strength and passion into an idle plunge away from you, dissipating into the thin air around the softly trembling steel. For a moment, you wish such splendid force and elegant might had been reserved for you instead. Such powerful movements, broken by moments of such form and calm.\n\n");

		outputText("Raphael has the energy left to manage a theatrical flourish. He swerves his feet about, moves his hands with temperament to strike a few poses, before he puts a hand on the hip of his one straight leg and raises his sword into the air with victorious bravado. \"<i>Footwork!</i>\" He proclaims.\n\n");

You refuse to give in and eventually, you become a slave to the rhythm instead. Your steps are simply that much more elegant, your performance that much more inspired, when you press your lush body into that of the handsome rogue and tighten your steps, loosening your turns. Before you know it, your body rubs and undulates eagerly against the driving fox, until finally, Raphael sweeps you backward. Missing a winding turn, he throws you around his body and catches you just before you fall to the moss.

In the tumble, Raphael has granted you control of his rapier.  You now hold onto his weapon, the hilt still warm.  It is such an empowering feeling that you begin to play with it, dancing and twirling along the moss a few times in an emulation of what Raphael did earlier.  You enjoy how it cleaves the air to your motions.  You're not as good as the fox yet, but it is liberating.  While you still feel nude in the clothes Raphael gave you, you also feel guarded behind the ornate hilt.

Basically you're stuck in your place, walking a straight line and jabbing it limply at an invisible opponent or twisting your wrist in awkward angles to learn all the different parries.

You can quite clearly feel the bulge in his pants ride into your [butt].  Raphael's tail flicks from side to side excitedly, perhaps betraying what the fox himself does not.

The fox is a good sport when you're already naked, and he allows you to take off his pants.  His bright red fox cock bobs seductively in front of the flawless white fur of his crotch, but it becomes clear that Raphael does not intend to use his fiery rapier this time.  Instead, he lays you down on your back, carefully positioning you with kisses and brushes.

Maintaining eye contact and without blinking, he rolls out his long red tongue and brushes it against your " + vaginaDescript(0) + ".  The sensation of the bawdy rough thing lapping up your sensitive gash's gathered dew takes you completely by surprise and you let your head fall back and moan.

Bold enough to enter the lion's den, you're assertive enough to not only meet his inquisitive snout head on, but take the initiative by climbing onto the Rogue.  You smile at each other as you grab him by his leather jacket and wrestle for a position on top.  There you sit on his lap, take him by his neck and press the kiss.  You can already feel his vulpine phallus rise up below his leather and in between your bodies.  Raphael's being good however and lets you have your fun. Only when you start plucking at his vest does he return the gesture.  Between your nimble hands and his, clothing is quickly shed and you soon find yourself straddled naked on top the fox's equally bare fur.  Raphael gives himself an easy time at it; now that you've gone this far, the fox simply sits back and leans in against the wall of pillows stacked behind him.  He gives you an expectant stare, like he's eager to see what you've got.");

Normally I slip it on unbeknownst to my lovers, but then again, none of them have been as proactive as you have been now.</i>\"");

With the faintest twitch of the hip, you can change its angle and run it through in an entirely different manner and you eagerly start experimenting with what feels best.  Eventually you settle on jutting your ass backwards and pressing the middlemost of his solid length against the front wall of your [vagina] while the tip bottoms out against the back.  The position does not go unnoticed to Raph, and he trails his paws along your [butt].  You begin to bounce around on top him, jamming him into you more firmly and more securely with every rut in.  Raphael supports you by either grabbing you by the ass or cupping your tits, playing with them with his sandy paws.  He sinks in heavily, smoothly, with every gulp of your tightening cunt accompanied by a little wet slush around his hard manhood.");

	outputText("\n\nWhen you ask him what he is about, Raphael's answer is a surprising one.  \"<i>About knowing succubi... yes, I knew quite a few quite intimately.  To say that I learned my skill at charming others from them wouldn't be far from the truth.</i>\"  He trails an idle finger across the rim of his goblet like he's reminiscing.  \"<i>The moment I became any good at remaining unseen, I made my way into the mountains to find one of these succubi.  I was young and curious.  I spied on them.  Let's say their pastime activities were of great interest to a young male.</i>\"  He grins.  \"<i>The moment I became good enough with the rapier to muster the courage, I confronted one.</i>\"  Raphael lets a deliberate pause fall in the discussion, lasting long enough for you to ask what happened next.  The fox gloats. \"<i>Let's just say I learned to realize what I want most from life, and the difference between loose women and dignified ladies.  Sneaking into their lairs makes you either a suicidal fool or a demon slaying hero and luckily, I am neither.  She played me for an idiot, telling me to just submit, lay down my weapon and get rewarded beyond my wildest dreams.  Enticing, true, but luckily, I found out that my desire to compete and win, is greater than my libido.  I recognized it as a game for control and not only did I manage to play along, but I began preying on her desires better than she could mine.  I never did lay down my rapier that night, always convincing her I either needed just one more sordid act to lose my mind to her, or already had.</i>\"  He observes.  \"<i>And the oddest thing happened.  The moment I was winning, I began losing interest in her.  My mind turned instead, to the city bank or some noble's vault, to ponder on how much harder these would be to get into than my lady friend.</i>\"  He chuckles a bit awkward.  \"<i>The following morning, I had gotten all I wanted from her and escaped unharmed.</i>\"");

	outputText("\n\nHe looks over to you and frowns, worried.  \"<i>I wouldn't recommend attempting the same though.  My first succubus was a very young one, almost a decade ago.  In my puberty, I would proceed to try and seduce several more - even two incubi - to charm my way out of trouble whilst seeking demon treasure, but as time passed, I got into serious trouble for it.  The smarter ones, higher up the ranks, outdid me and I can personally attest how demons have a corrupting influence to them.  Simply being around to stalk them was enough to make me careless.  I became addicted to the thrill.  Had I not broken a leg, forcing me to recover in the city and giving me time to reflect and recover, I'm not sure if I would be around today.  I mean, you can only pick the lock on the tiny cage they're using to cart you up the mountain so many times, before they decide to simply fuse it.</i>\"  He smiles.  \"<i>By then, I had learned to appreciate finer things. I have little enduring interest in the corrupt.</i>\"");

	outputText("\n\n\"<i>But what I mean to say, is this: I put value in things such as modesty, dignity, decorum and a sense of style.  I don't think that demons do, or at least not in a way that would preserve these virtues.</i>\"  Raphael clears his throat and dips back into metaphors.  \"<i>I'm not about theft.  I'm about getting into hard to reach places.  I don't care what's in the vault.  Whatever it is, it must be valuable to be there, behind all those intricate traps, delicate locks, ornate guards and cultural heritage.  To finesse my way through all of that?</i>\"");

	outputText("\n\nRaphael smirks and turns towards you, leans on one paw and gazes into your eyes.  \"<i>I just can't get enough of tweaking knobs, hitting a lock's sweet spot, or getting my fingers in places where they don't belong, amidst all that splendor.</i>\"");
