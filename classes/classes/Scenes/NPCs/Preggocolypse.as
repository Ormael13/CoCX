		outputText("Giving your bashful lover a wink, you ask him if he didn’t get a thorough enough examination last time.  \n\n");

		outputText("A little surprised, you ask if he can really tell so soon. He nods. “Yes, but I need…contact to be sure.”  \n\n");
        outputText("You decide to humour Arian, especially if he can see so early. You bare your stomach, and he steps gingerly in, placing a scaly hand on you. Arian closes his eyes, and you can feel a little tingle as a pulse of mana flows through you.  \n\n");
		outputText("Arian opens his eyes, and you can see a single tear well up in his left eye. You ask him what’s wrong, and he wraps his arms around you, squeezing shockingly tight for someone of his health. \n\n");
		outputText("“You’re pregnant.” He says simply. “With my children.” His voice is thick, and as you pull your head back to look at him, he’s shaking slightly, a smile on his face, and joy in his eyes.  \n\n");
        outputText("You ask him if he wants a family, and he closes his mouth, nodding once. “I…I came out here…because my job in Tel’adre was done.” He speaks slowly, with a trembling voice. “I know that you’re busy. That your mission is…Too important to stop, and too dangerous for me to come with you…” He plants his feet, giving you a stern look. “But by Marae, you’d better come back to me.”\n\n");
		outputText("You almost laugh, a single tear now in your eye. You tell Arian that you’ll do your best.  \n\n");
		outputText("“I’ll sic the girls on you.” Arian threatens, and the thought of Arian’s former apprentices coming out to the wilderness to fight you cracks you up. You snicker, and this gets Arian laughing. \n\n");
        outputText("You and your lizan lover start howling with laughter, until he’s wheezing, holding onto you to stay upright.  \n\n");
		outputText("“Really though…” He says, wiping a tear from his eye. “Promise me. No needless risks. I worry about you.”  \n\n");
        outputText("You hold Arian close, and you can tell this is bothering him. You softly whisper into Arian’s ear, telling him that you’ll try, and that’s all you can promise. You tell him that you’re strong, able to handle most threats in this realm…But that nothing is a guarantee these days. Especially for those who oppose the demons. He steps back, shoulders slack. \n\n");
		outputText("“I know.” Arian whispers. “Gods above, I know.” He sighs, giving you a wistful look. “Now I know how my apprentices felt.” You raise an eyebrow, and he scowls slightly. “I want to lock you in an ensorcelled room, where nothing can reach you. Where you’ll be safe and happy, and…” He blushes, looking down and away from you. “...Where we can raise our brood in peace.”  \n\n");
        outputText("You gently take his hands in yours, telling Arian that he knows personally how that feels from the other side. That while such an existence is safe…it’s not a life, not really. \n\n");

        outputText("He leans in, wrapping his tail gently around your waist. “Mind if I join you?” You just nod, and he beams. “I don’t know if…This helps at all…But you look really good right now.” He blushes, and you give the lizan mage a raised eyebrow.  \n\n");

        outputText("You playfully punch his shoulder, telling Arian that at least one of you is having fun with it. He laughs at that, looking into your eyes. “M-may I?” He motions at your pregnant belly, and you nod, leaning back slightly. He slowly, with awe in his eyes, rests his hand on your stomach. A thin glow radiates from his palm, and you gasp. The uncomfortable grinding feeling begins to fade, and once he’s done, you feel much better.  \n\n");
		outputText("“It’s not uncommon for Lizan females to experience abdominal discomfort when carrying, especially later on in their development.” He gives you a kiss on the forehead. “All I did was move two of the eggs a little apart.” Arian stands, moving back to his tent. “Please wait here for a moment.” You feel much more comfortable, and don’t really feel like moving anyways.  \n\n");
        outputText("Arian comes back a few minutes later, with a metal flask proudly held in one hand. He gives it to you. “Lizan villages often kept a supply of whitebud herbs around, for egg-bearing women. It helps with digestion, has many nutrients for growing eggs, and helps maintain the coating between eggs.” You nod, thanking him for the thought. “Some prefer eating them, but traditionally, it’s boiled into a tea.”  \n\n");
		outputText("You take a small sip, and…It’s not bad. A little bitter at first, but that quickly fades, replaced with a sour-sweet taste that reminds you of lemongrass. As you swallow, a fuzzy heat spreads through you. You almost feel a little lighter, the eggs not weighing as much on your womb. You smile, patting the side of the log for your lover to join you. Arian happily sits right beside you, and the two of you spend some time, just sitting by the fire, watching the world spin.  \n\n");
        outputText("“I love you.” He whispers, resting his cheek on your shoulder. The fatigue of the day seems to wash away, and you rest your head on his, gently leaning in. After another fifteen minutes of warm, affectionate silence, he speaks once more. “Mareth…Isn’t such a bad place…Once you find the right people to share it with.” \n\n");
        outputText("You find yourself agreeing…But a few minutes later, you pull away, letting Arian know that the moment has passed. He looks disappointed, but lets go, standing with you. “So…You’re leaving again.” He seems to want to say more. Filled with affection, you take his hands in yours, bringing your lips to his. The kiss is gentle, not filled with fiery passion, but calm, stable love.  \n\n");
		outputText("You tell Arian that yes, you’re leaving. As you must…And you’ll return, as you always do. You tell Arian that even carrying his eggs, you can still destroy the demons…And now, you have even more reason to. To make sure they get the best chances you can give them. \n\n");
        outputText("“...If they inherit even a tiny fraction of your kindness and strength, they’ll be shining beacons for Mareth.” Arian seems comforted by your words. You bid farewell to Arian, turning with determination to the wilderness. Nothing on Mareth can stop you now! \n\n");

She sits down, motioning for you to join her. You see no reason to stay standing, and as Arian hands you a cup of tea, she looks down at the table, blushing slightly.  \n\n");
		outputText("“...So…I don’t know how much you know about Lizan anatomy…” She begins, tapping one foot. “But the last time we…Made love, it was a day where my eggs were…Available.” You blink, before clarifying. So Arian is…Pregnant? \n\n");

		outputText("You ask her if it has more to do with the fact that she was born male, and Arian sighs, nodding slowly. “I know the alchemist who made the potion quite well, and that she wouldn’t have given me a dud…but I still worry.” You give Arian a reassuring smile and tell her that, worse comes to worst, you try again. You bring a hand to Arian’s cheek, telling her that no matter what, she’s still going to be here, and so will you.  \n\n");
        outputText("“Th-thank you.” Arian blushes at the attention, leaning in and resting her head against yours. “I’ll be fine now, if you need to go…Just promise to come back to me.” You promise, and she smiles, her hands no longer shaking. She lets go, and puts a hand to her stomach. “Well…I suppose I can’t really do much magic for the next few days.”  \n\n");

		outputText("“Hello…” She says, waving her free hand. “How are you?” You take her hand, saying that you’re fine…But you’re more worried about her.  \n\n");

		outputText("You almost sigh in relief. You agree, and Arian motions for you to sit beside her. You comply, and she happily plops herself in your lap, leaning back into you. “Thank you!” She says happily, guiding your hand to her stomach.  \n\n");
		outputText("You slide Arian’s robe aside, massaging the soft scales until you find a hard section. As soon as you touch there, she lets out a muffled grunt. “Don’t stop.” You massage around the hard spot, and with each rub, Arian leans back, resting more of her weight onto you. You find another hard area, and begin massaging with your other hand. Arian squirms, letting out a happy little squeal. \n\n");

You finger her at a moderate pace, reveling in her squirming on your lap. After a minute or so, Arian turns, still in your lap, facing you with a sheepish look on her face.  \n\n");

Very handy.” You help her over to the chair, and she strips out of her robe and undergarments, giving them to you.
