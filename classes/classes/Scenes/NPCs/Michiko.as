Quite the impressive escape you made, might I add. Like I said, it’s rare that champions make it past their first day, let alone a week, seems you’ve been doing well for yourself, [name].</i>\" She stares at you with a mischievous glint in her eyes.\n\n");

A bit startled and embarrassed, you thank her for the food and grab a few gems for her work. \"<i>It’s alright, [name]. It was my request, it’s my responsibility to pay.</i>\" Michiko has already moved to pay, a large sum of gems gleaming in her hand. The waitress thanks her and bows to both of you, and takes her leave.\n\n");
	outputText("Returning your attention to you stalker, you begin your barrage of questions. How did she know where to look when you came through the portal? How long has she been keeping her eyes on you? What else does she know about you? Why are you the focus of her stalking? And why is she even stalking you in the first place? Isn’t this land too dangerous for someone of her small stature to be running around so carelessly?\n\n");

I do owe you some answers for watching you as long as I have, but you gotta give me some time to answer back!</i>\" She’s right and you do admit that it was rude to start flooding the person you just met with questions. You apologize and sit back, letting her have the floor.\n\n");

I’ve been around doing what I do long enough to know when each new champion is coming through. So, when it was time for that portal to spit out some new sucker, I was ready. ");

	outputText("\"<i>And as for how long I’ve been watching you, ever since you left the portal. I always stick close to my source. It’s mostly because it’s my job, but also because I was interested in you. Not so much the person, but more so where you’d end up. Most champs I see are captured, no surprise there, ");
	outputText("but the ones that aren’t are a little special. They warrant a closer watch. Sometimes they end up fine, and other times they don’t. I hope you prove to be a little more interesting than the previous champs. So far, you have.</i>\"\n\n");
	outputText("Her answers, as far as you can tell, are nothing but truth. She also answered every other question you had in one fell swoop. Seems she is just an innocent stalker. And if she’s so insistent on stalking you, it’s her decision. Judging by how long she said she’s been watching you, you wouldn’t be able to stop her if you tried. The only question that remains is, why did she approach you? She had no reason to, so why now?\n\n");
	outputText("\"<i>Well, champ, I had a question for you myself. You see, as I’ve said before you’re not the only one I keep tabs on. I know a lot of things and a lot of people. I hear rumors here and there, and make a living of off selling my information. Usually people want to know where the dangerous areas are or what’s going on in a certain place. And I know for a fact that you’ll need someone who has these answers by your side.</i>\"\n\n");

I’ve got a knowing feeling that you’ll be going far. That feeling has never been wrong the few times I’ve had it. That’s why I want to come with you. Plus, it’d be pretty stupid to say no to free information, wouldn’t it?</i>\"\n\n");
	outputText("Free information is never something to pass up, but she wants to join you on a hunch? She understands the risk that comes with tagging along with a champion, she’s even said she’s not a fighter yet she still wants to come along?\n\n");

I don’t care about the danger, not if it means I get to do my job as best I can. You don’t have to worry about my safety either. I’ve been following you for a while and you’ve never picked up on me. And trust me when I say that I know how to lay low.</i>\"\n\n");

You both finish around the same time, and you thank her once more for purchasing the food for you. \"<i>Really, it’s no trouble at all, [name]. For now, I’ll get started moving to camp.
