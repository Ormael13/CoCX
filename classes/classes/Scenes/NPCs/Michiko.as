The only question that remains is, why did she approach you? She had no reason to, so why now?\n\n");

I’ve got a knowing feeling that you’ll be going far. That feeling has never been wrong the few times I’ve had it. That’s why I want to come with you. Plus, it’d be pretty stupid to say no to free information, wouldn’t it?</i>\"\n\n");

I don’t care about the danger, not if it means I get to do my job as best I can. You don’t have to worry about my safety either. I’ve been following you for a while and you’ve never picked up on me.
