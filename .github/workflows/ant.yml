# This workflow will build a Java project with Ant
# For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/building-and-testing-java-with-ant

name: ActionScript 3 CI

# Github workflows do not support actionscript directly.
# However the build uses ant, which is usually used to build java projects.
# The ant task (mxmlc) provided by the flex SDK (ant/lib/flexTasks.jar) is used to build the project.
